## Hi there 👋

### 🔭 I’m currently working on  
- Building large-scale **recommendation systems** (offline ranking, online reranking, Redis-based serving, ANN research).  
- Developing **fraud-detection pipelines** (XGBoost, feature engineering, multi-source ingestion, risk-tier scoring).  
- Automating **HR appraisal workflows** end-to-end (Google Apps Script, Gmail threading, Drive integration, error-resilient orchestration).  
- Designing **WhatsApp automation** (WABA templates, interactive flows, media handling, n8n orchestration, dynamic payloads).  
- Leading AI squads delivering **document intelligence, RAG systems, and court-automation** for UAE government projects.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning  
- Advanced **AI engineering & inference optimization**  
- **AWS Developer Associate** concepts  
- High-performance **vector search & retrieval** (FAISS, Redis-VL, Qdrant)  
- Scaling ML systems to millions of users

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on  
- Real-world **AI automations**, LLM-powered workflows, ML production systems  
- Recommendation systems, fraud detection, RAG, or enterprise AI projects

### 💬 Ask me about  
- Data pipelines, ML modeling, feature engineering  
- LLM automation & multi-agent design  
- Scalable system architecture  
- WABA message automation & growth engineering

### ⚡ Fun fact  
I spent 2 months debugging meta WABA platform and told my employer it become personal😡. IDC how bad the tool is if there is engineers out there who can do it then I can do it too (I was right)
