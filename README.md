## Hi there 👋
My name is Ahmed Hesham, experinced ML engineer writing production grade code, enjoying requirement gathering and problem framing as well as solution design and forcasting future problems and hypothies testing.
have worked in private governmental projects, entriprise projects. with the start-up fast base and variable workloads nuture.
have worked on agentic AI, Document workflow and automation using LLMs and OCRs

### 🔭 I’m currently working on  
- Building large-scale **recommendation systems** (offline ranking, online reranking, Redis-based serving, ANN research).  
- Developing **fraud-detection pipelines** (XGBoost, feature engineering, multi-source ingestion, risk-tier scoring).  
- Automating **HR appraisal workflows** end-to-end (Google Apps Script, Gmail threading, Drive integration, error-resilient orchestration).  
- supporting **[WhatsApp Sender](https://github.com/devahmedhesham-ML/whatsapp_sender)** (send high volume whatsapp campaign ).  
- Leading AI squads delivering **document intelligence, RAG systems, and court-automation** for UAE government projects.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning  
- advanced **recommendation systems** from scratch for large-scale user serving.
- distributed systems and serverless architecture concepts
- High-performance **vector search & retrieval** (FAISS, Redis-VL, Qdrant)  
- Scaling ML systems to millions of users

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on  
- Real-world **AI automations**, LLM-powered workflows, ML production systems  
- Recommendation systems, fraud detection, RAG, or Agentic AI projects
- Open Source AI framework contribution or islamic app contribution 

### 💬 Ask me about  
- Data pipelines, ML modeling, feature engineering  
- LLM automation & multi-agent design  
- Scalable system architecture  
- WABA message automation & growth engineering

### ⚡ Fun fact  
I spent 2 months debugging meta WABA platform and told my employer it become personal😡. IDC how bad the tool is if there is engineers out there who can do it then I can do it too (I was right)
